{"sessionDescription": "Breathing, meditation, and visualization techniques for optimal performances.\r\n\r\nAll of us have experienced the \u201cbutterflies\u201d before a musical performance, a speech, or a confrontation with another individual.  This interactive session will help identify situations that cause anxiety and techniques to relieve or embrace this anxiety.  Oftentimes, the physical effects of so-called \u201cnervousness\u201d can often help us think more clearly and perform at a higher level! \r\nThe session is not only for performing musicians, but it is for anyone who wants to reduce anxiety and resilience in daily life.  We will explore together visualization and relaxation techniques, skills to keep our minds sharp and in control, as well as ways in which our smart devices can help us find a sense of calm.  These habits can help us improve our communication, relationships, and overall quality of life.", "sessionEndDateTime": "2024-06-30T13:00:00", "sessionName": "Befriending the Butterflies: Techniques for Embracing Performance Anxiety", "sessionStartDateTime": "2024-06-30T12:00:00", "sessionStub": "B41D02BE-B4A4-42BB-AC98-484ED7DF1D6A", "speakerCategory": ["Presenter"], "speakers": ["476FFA5D-F7F5-41FA-B5CD-7B4179883E46"], "timezoneName": "Pacific Time", "updatedDate": "2023-09-19"}
