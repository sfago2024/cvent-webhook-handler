Come and find out what we have accomplished since spring of 2020, learn about our future goals, and get a quick rundown of some of our favorite works by women composers. In addition, we will address the problem of accessibility of music by women, we will hear from SWO members about the progress on their Adjustable Bench Campaign, and end with a Q&A: What are your concerns? And how can we help?", "sessionEndDateTime": "2024-07-02T13:00:00", "sessionName": "The Growing Sisterhood of Organists: AGO Task Force for Gender Equity/Society for Women Organists", "sessionStartDateTime": "2024-07-02T12:00:00", "sessionStub": "177E8003-A227-4088-A89A-69381A8D00C1", "speakerCategory": ["Moderator", "Panelist", "Panelist", "Panelist", "Panelist"], "speakers": ["A88B02B7-F9BB-42E4-870E-07FE16FCF834", "A6F578D0-F79E-44BD-8F09-0BDFC29D0391", "62B45B05-B7ED-406F-80F4-15E6CF49C7A2", "2FA87179-45AD-418C-B12F-437626FE5BD1", "2E2FE900-1640-4878-8072-C502CDC0C8B4"], "timezoneName": "Pacific Time", "updatedDate": "2023-09-04"}
