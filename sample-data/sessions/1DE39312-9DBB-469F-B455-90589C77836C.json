{"sessionDescription": "A practical workshop on how our thoughtful use of personal expertise can enhance our practice time.\r\n\r\nPracticing the organ requires a significant amount of mental and physical energy, but the reality of busy lives often leaves us rushing to brush up repertoire for services or upcoming performances. With little time to waste, informed, deliberate practice that utilizes our knowledge of ourselves and our personal strengths to target the most relevant challenges becomes a necessity for the highest level of confidence in our playing while using our time as efficiently as possible. With this in mind, concert organist Katelyn Emerson shares practical strategies for deliberate practice informed by studies into how mind and body work together to deepen our understanding of and enhance our playing of music. As you are comfortable, please bring your own practice strategies or any particular practice issues to share and discuss!", "sessionEndDateTime": "2024-06-30T13:00:00", "sessionName": "Deliberate Practice for the Mind and Body of the Organist", "sessionStartDateTime": "2024-06-30T12:00:00", "sessionStub": "1DE39312-9DBB-469F-B455-90589C77836C", "speakerCategory": ["Organist"], "speakers": ["66471773-7004-4699-9C1F-02A330057DE5"], "timezoneName": "Pacific Time", "updatedDate": "2023-09-04"}
