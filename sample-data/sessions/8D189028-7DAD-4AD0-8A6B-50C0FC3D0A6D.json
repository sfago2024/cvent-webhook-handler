{"sessionDescription": "The 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition and the Golden Age of the American Pipe Organ \r\n\r\nFrom February to December 1915, San Francisco welcomed 18 million visitors to the highly successful Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE). Situated on 600 acres of waterfront in what is today\u2019s marina district, this impressive world\u2019s fair commemorating the completion of the Panama Canal offered visitors a myriad of exhibits relating to industry, technology, and the arts. One of the exhibits was a new organ built by the Austin Organ Company the exposition\u2019s Festival Hall. The organ was used for daily concerts by the day\u2019s leading organists, including the British virtuoso Edwin H. Lemare, who played 100 concerts over the course of six weeks. \r\n\r\nIn this period of history, the pipe organ stood at the intersection of industry, technology, culture, and commerce, and it epitomized the spirit of progress that was so intrinsic to U.S. world\u2019s fairs. Organ series were an important feature of the music programs at the expositions in Chicago, Buffalo, and St. Louis, and San Francisco\u2019s event followed those models. These events introduced the organ to a general audience and paved the way for a golden age of civic organ building and culture in this country. \r\n\r\nDrawing on archival research in UCLA Berkeley\u2019s Bancroft Library and publications by Austin Opus 500 expert Justin Kielty, this presentation will share the fascinating story of the PPIE organ series while placing it in the larger context of world\u2019s fair scholarship and the history of the pipe organ in the U.S.", "sessionEndDateTime": "2024-06-30T13:00:00", "sessionName": "Organ Concerts at San Francisco\u2019s World\u2019s Fair", "sessionStartDateTime": "2024-06-30T12:00:00", "sessionStub": "8D189028-7DAD-4AD0-8A6B-50C0FC3D0A6D", "speakerCategory": ["Organist"], "speakers": ["DF5790FB-1F67-4F18-B30A-CFA3337CD1E8"], "timezoneName": "Pacific Time", "updatedDate": "2023-09-04"}
