{"sessionDescription": "The organ acts as a storyteller for 19th and 20th century Chinese composers\r\n\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte said, \u201cLet China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world.\u201d On the other side of the world lies a country full of unheard stories. These stories have the power to shake the world, and there\u2019s no better instrument to bring those stories across the Pacific than the organ. \r\n\r\nThe organ will serve as a link between Eastern and Western traditions. Even though the body of Chinese music written for the organ is quite small, the instrument\u2019s diverse array of sounds enables us to explore Chinese music written for orchestra, keyboard, and traditional Chinese instruments. \r\n\r\nRather than focusing on the history of the pipe organ in China, this session will focus on 19th and 20th century Chinese composers and their stories. Attendees will learn about these composers and the forces that shaped their pieces, and after each piece is introduced, Ms. Chiu will perform it. \r\n\r\nAttendees will not only walk away from this session with an increased knowledge of Chinese music and culture, but also an increased desire to diversify their repertoire. We will delve into how YOU can expand the organ literature. Both the stories you\u2019ll hear and your personal stories have the power to shake the world.", "sessionEndDateTime": "2024-06-30T13:00:00", "sessionName": "From Bamboo to Bourdon: Stories from China", "sessionStartDateTime": "2024-06-30T12:00:00", "sessionStub": "52ABBA22-26AE-4884-B07C-EF4F2E2F8CF3", "speakerCategory": ["Organist"], "speakers": ["645E8D0F-BC56-4EA4-BDF9-153106B1BDB6"], "timezoneName": "Pacific Time", "updatedDate": "2023-09-04"}
