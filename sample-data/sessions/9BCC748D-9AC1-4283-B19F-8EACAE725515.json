{"sessionDescription": "Identifying successful practice and performance strategies\r\n\r\nWhy do so many organists find it hard to perform brilliantly?  Whether the performance is spoiled by wayward limbs, habitual or new errors, self-doubt or distracting mind-games, the cause is probably the same: poorly chosen repertoire coupled with imperfect practice methods.  The workshop addresses all these performance problems in turn, showing how effective training of a well-chosen piece inspires the player, builds confidence and concentration and results in a reliable and brilliant performance.", "sessionEndDateTime": "2024-07-01T13:00:00", "sessionName": "How to perform brilliantly", "sessionStartDateTime": "2024-07-01T12:00:00", "sessionStub": "9BCC748D-9AC1-4283-B19F-8EACAE725515", "speakerCategory": ["Organist"], "speakers": ["A6F578D0-F79E-44BD-8F09-0BDFC29D0391"], "timezoneName": "Pacific Time", "updatedDate": "2023-09-04"}
